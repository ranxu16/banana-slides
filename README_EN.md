## ✨ Project Origins

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: a presentation is due tomorrow, but your PPT is still a complete blank; your head is full of brilliant ideas, yet your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and aesthetically pleasing. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still face the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low creative freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult to execute.
- 3️⃣ Similar-looking outputs with severe homogeneity.
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack relevance and specificity.
- 5️⃣ Fragmented layout of text and images with poor design quality.

These shortcomings make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our two major needs: "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPTs" are, in my eyes, still far from being "Vibe" enough.

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro to generate PPT pages and found that the results—in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency—were exceptional. It can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompts while strictly following the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate beautiful PPTs with zero barrier and no design experience, reducing the hassle of template selection.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Reference AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and graphics to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to improve classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete assignment presentations, focusing energy on content rather than layout and styling.
5. **Professionals**: Rapidly visualize business proposals and product introductions with quick adaptation for various scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, allowing everyone to quickly create beautiful and professional presentations</b>
</p>

  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (For GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models via a GCP service account; new users can use promotional credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the JSON key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If using Docker for deployment, you also need to uncomment the relevant lines in `docker-compose.yml` to mount the key file into the container and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`.

</details>

2. **Start the Service**

**⚡ Using Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synchronized with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip local build steps and achieve rapid deployment:

```bash

# Start with Pre-built Images (No Need to Build from Scratch)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

After startup, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the app. The app will determine if an update is available based on the current version SHA; when running from source, the current Git SHA will also be used for comparison.

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configuration in the `.env` file and rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```


3. **Access the Application**

```

5. **Stop Services**

```bash
docker compose down
```

6. **Update Project**

**Using Pre-built Images (docker-compose.prod.yml)**

You can also go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application to see if a new version is available.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Using Local Build (docker-compose.yml)**

Note: If you have manually modified the code, this method is not applicable. You need to revert the code to the pulled version first.

```bash
git pull 
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Deploy from source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for exporting lecture videos, and must include `libass` / `ass` subtitle filter support
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when uploading PPTX files using the "PPT Refurbish" feature, used to convert PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading**. Reason: LibreOffice may cause layout displacement during server-side rendering due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore some special effects. LibreOffice is not required for uploading PDF files. Docker users who still need PPTX upload support within the container can execute:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost after the container is rebuilt and will need to be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run in the project root directory:
```bash

# macOS (Homebrew)

brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full

# Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9

# Then install Python dependencies

uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

# Then, following the previously mentioned method, open and edit the `.env` file to configure your API key

# Instructions

This is a Markdown translation task.

#### Frontend Installation

1. **Enter the frontend directory**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure API address**

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service specified by `BACKEND_PORT` (default `http://localhost:5011`) via Vite proxy. To modify this, please set `BACKEND_PORT` in the `.env` file at the project root.

#### Start Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important local data, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`
> Note: Under the default configuration, templates, assets, and finished products are all located in the `uploads/` folder

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5011`.

Visit `http://localhost:5011/health` to verify if the service is running correctly.

#### Start the Frontend Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3011`.

Open your browser to access the application.
