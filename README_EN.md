## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this dilemma: a presentation is due tomorrow, but your slides are still blank; your head is full of brilliant ideas, but all your passion is drained by tedious layout and design work?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and aesthetically pleasing. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the demand for "speed," several issues remain:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates, unable to flexibly adjust styles
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult
- 3️⃣ Similar visual outcomes with severe homogenization
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets lacking specificity
- 5️⃣ Disconnected text-image layouts and poor design aesthetics

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy the two core needs of "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, still far from truly having that "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana 🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro for PPT page generation and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. Furthermore, it can accurately render almost all text required by the prompt while following the style of a reference image. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Generate aesthetic PPTs quickly with zero barrier and no design experience required, reducing the hassle of choosing templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Reference AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and visual elements to quickly spark design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into illustrated PPT lesson plans to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Rapidly complete presentation assignments and focus energy on content rather than layout and beautification.
5. **Business Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions with rapid adaptation to various scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, enabling everyone to quickly create aesthetic and professional presentations.</b>

**Use the new editable export configuration method to achieve better editable export results**: You need to obtain an API KEY from the [Baidu AI Cloud Platform](https://console.bce.baidu.com/iam/#/iam/apikey/list) (click here to enter), and fill it into the `BAIDU_API_KEY` field in the `.env` file (sufficient free quota is available). See the instructions in https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121 for details.


<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (for GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models via a GCP service account; new users can use free credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the JSON key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml`, mount the key file into the container, and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`

</details>

2. **Starting the Service**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest main branch version), allowing you to skip local build steps for fast deployment:

```bash

# Start with Pre-built Image (No need to build from scratch)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

After starting, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application. The app will determine if there is an available update based on the current version SHA; when running from source code, the current Git SHA will also be used for this determination.

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file and then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```


3. **Access the Application**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

4. **View Logs**

```bash
```

# View Backend Logs (Last 200 Lines)

docker logs --tail 200 banana-slides-backend

# Real-time Backend Log Viewing (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs -f --tail 100 banana-slides-backend

# View Frontend Logs (Last 100 Lines)

```bash
docker logs --tail 100 banana-slides-frontend
```

5. **Stop Services**

```bash
docker compose down
```

6. **Update Project**

**Using Pre-built Images (docker-compose.prod.yml)**

You can also check for a new version within the app by going to **Settings → About → Check for Updates**.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Using Local Build (docker-compose.yml)**

Note: If you have manually modified the code, this method is not applicable. You must first revert the code to the version at the time of the last pull.

```bash
git pull 
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Deploy from source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for exporting explanation videos, and must include `libass` / `ass` subtitle filter support
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when using the "PPT Refurbishment" feature to upload PPTX files, used to convert PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading.** Reason: LibreOffice may cause layout misalignment during server-side rendering due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore some special effects. Uploading PDF files does not require LibreOffice. Docker users who still need to support PPTX upload within the container can execute:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost when the container is recreated and must be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the code repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run in the project root directory:
```bash

# macOS (Homebrew)

brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full

# Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9
```

# Then install Python dependencies

uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure environment variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

# Then, follow the previously mentioned method to open and edit the `.env` file and configure your API key

It appears that the "Original content" section of your request is empty. Please provide the Chinese Markdown text you would like translated into English between the code blocks, and I will be happy to assist you while following all your requirements (keeping formatting, HTML tags, and URLs unchanged).

#### Frontend Installation

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure API address**

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service at `http://localhost:5000`. If you need to modify this, please edit `src/api/client.ts`.

#### Start Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important local data, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`
> Note: Under default configuration, templates, assets, and finished products are all stored in the `uploads/` folder.

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

Visit `http://localhost:5000/health` to verify that the service is running correctly.

#### Start the Frontend Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open your browser to access and use the application.
